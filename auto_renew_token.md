# 🚀 Best Practice Recommendation

✅ **Use `token_period` instead of `token_ttl`** for an auto-renewable token.
✅ **Use a renewal script** if you have to handle token expiry manually.
🚫 **Avoid long-lived tokens (`token_ttl=0`)** unless absolutely necessary.

## 🔄 How to Renew a Vault Token

### ✅ Manually Renew an Existing Token
To renew an active Vault token before it expires, run:

```sh
vault token renew <your-token>
```

### 🔹 How It Works
- If the token is **valid and renewable**, this command extends its lifetime.
- **It will not work if:**
  - The token has already expired.
  - The token is not renewable (check with `vault token lookup <your-token>`).
  - The token has exceeded its **maximum TTL (`token_max_ttl`)**.

### 🔄 Check if Your Token is Renewable
Before attempting renewal, check if your token can be renewed:

```sh
vault token lookup <your-token>
```

✔ If the output contains `renewable: true`, you can renew it.

### ✅ Extend Token Lifetime Before Expiry

```sh
vault token renew -increment=24h <your-token>
```

✔ This adds **24 hours** to the token’s lifetime.

## ✅ Automatically Renew the Token in Node.js

If your application uses Vault, you can auto-renew the token in **Node.js**:

```javascript
const vault = require("node-vault")({ endpoint: "http://127.0.0.1:8200" });

async function renewToken() {
    try {
        const response = await vault.tokenRenewSelf();
        console.log("🔄 Token renewed successfully!", response);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error("⚠️ Token renewal failed:", err);
    }
}

// Run every 30 minutes (adjust as needed)
setInterval(renewToken, 30 * 60 * 1000);
```

✔ This automatically renews the token **every 30 minutes**.

## 🚨 If Token is Expired

If your token is **already expired**, you need to **log in again** instead of renewing.

```sh
vault write auth/approle/login role_id="your-role-id" secret_id="your-secret-id"
```

✔ This will generate a **new token**.

## 🎯 Best Practice

✅ Renew tokens **before they expire**.
✅ Use **`token_period`** instead of `token_ttl` for continuous renewal.
✅ **Monitor Vault logs** to ensure renewal is happening correctly.
🚫 Avoid **permanent tokens (`token_tt
